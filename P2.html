        <h2>Administrative details</h2>
        <p>The name of our client is Pareto Invest NTNU, and our contact person within the company is Eirik Lile Vaagen.</p>
        </section>


        <section class="avsnitt">
        <h2>Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
        <p>The client wants a stylish website that provides a good overview of the group that runs Pareto Invest. The two goals of the website is
            to reqruit new members, and to provide a front for companies that Pareto Invest wish to cooperate with - both sponsors and partners.
            The website should therefor provide easy access to information about what Pareto Invest is and how they are working. </p>
        </section>


        <section class="avsnitt">
        <h2>Navigation structure</h2>
            <p>The navigation structure is an important part of the website and the usability.
            Without a good navigation structure, people visting the website may not find what they are looking for. The users
            should have a lot of freedom, and also easily understand the structure of the website.</p>
            <p>As written, our client wishes that the website provides easy access to information about Pareto Invest. Therefore, we have
            decided to have a clique navigation structure, where you can access every page of the webpage from every page. It should 
            be possible to reach the homepage with clicking the at the logo, and the navigation bar will be accessable from all pages.
            In the navigation bar, there will be links pointing to each page. Some of these will not be visible before they are hovered
            upon (dropdown navigation bar), but it should still be possible to reach any page in three or less clicks, which is another goal.</p>

        <section class="avsnitt">
        <h2>Page layout and appearance</h2>
        <p>The universel theme or design is an important part of the users' first impressions of the website, but also of Pareto Invest.
            Our client wishes a professional, simple, and clean design, which reflects the group. Since providing (easy access to) information
            is one of the main goals of the website, the navigation bar should be in focus. The tabs in the navigation bar
            should provide information about what will be found inside the different pages, which will give the users a good overview of
            what the website contains. A professional appearance will also make the group more attractive to 
            students and potential sponsors and investors, which is a crucial part of the website, and one of the main reasons that 
            the website should be created in the first place.
        </p>
        
        <p>The specific styling for the website that will apply to all pages are listed below.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Font</li>

            <li>Body width</li>
            <li>Links
                <br>
                The users should be able to reach the homepage from any page, by clicking at the logo
                "Pareto Invest". Also, the navigation bar will be a dropdown menu, which contain 
                links to all pages in the website.
            </li>

                <br>
                The navigation bar will be located on the top of the page, and will be available on
                all pages. When hovering over the navigation bar, the particular tab will change
                colour to a darker shade.
            </li>
            <li>Banner</li>
            <li>Footer
                <br>

            </li>
            <li>Background image</li>
            <li>Border image</li>
            <li>Logo
                <br>
                Pareto Invest's logo will be located in the upper left corner on the website, and should be 
                visible on all pages. 
            </li>

        <h2>Content</h2>

        <p>There will be six separate pages as follows:</p>

        <h3>homepage.html</h3>
        <p>As the homepage will be the first page to appear when visiting the site, we want a clear design that isn’t too loud or noisy 
            as a first impression. As Pareto Invest is an investment group, we want it to have a professional and clean look. Therefore, 
            it should not be too much information on this page, it may be experienced as overwhelming. The information will be provided in other pages on the website.</p>
        <p>The homepage should contain a large picture of the logo as well as the name, so that the user quickly will understand who the 
            site belongs to. In addition, the client has requested a continuous live-updating of the fonds development 
            (with inspiration from Oljefondet).</p>
        <p>Picture...</p>

        <h3>about.html</h3>
        <p>The “About” page should be the page where the users will find the information about Pareto invest.
            This page will provide some sort of biography of the group, how they are working, what their goals are,
            and who they are.</p>
        <p>This page is a contributor in achieving the goal that is to provide easy access to information of the group.
            Therefore, the information should be the main part of the page. It will be one of the first impressions for students, 
            and potential sponsors and partners, which again emphasizes the importance of a clean and simple structure.</p>
        <p>There will also be an image of the group on this page. This picture should be … (position, size, border…)</p>

        <h3>contact.html</h3>
        <p>The “contact” page will allow the user to easily get an overview on how and where to get in contact with Pareto Invest.
            We will include an address to the office (linked to maps), linking to other social media and contact information to the 
            groups appointed contact person/appointed contact email. This page will help fullfilling the goal of the website being a
            platform where students, sponsors and partners (both existing and potential) can reach Pareto Invest.</p>
        <p>The map...</p>

        <h3>sponsors.html</h3>
        <p>The “sponsors” page will provide a systematic and clear overview of the sponsors, ideally in a gallery-layout. This way, 
            the user can find out more about the group's collaboration partners, and thereby get into further research. This is important 
            to provide as much information as possible, and thereby build Pareto Invests credibility towards the user. </p>
        <p>The pictures...</p>

        <h3>macroeconomic_report.html</h3>
        <p>This page will contain the macroeconomic reports from Pareto Invest. Uploading continuous reports is beyond what we will 
            learn but we will create the shell so the client has the opportunity to create it later. The reports is an important part
            of Pareto Invest's work. In addition, it is something the target audience of the website most probably is interested in, 
            and it should therefor be included. This helps achieving the goals of provided information, and attracting sponsors/partners
            and new students.</p>

        <h3>quarterly_report.html</h3>
        <p>This page will contain the quarterly reports from Pareto Invest. Uploading continuous reports is beyond what we will 
            learn but we will create the shell so the client has the opportunity to create it later. The reports is an important part
            of Pareto Invest's work. In addition, it is something the target audience of the website most probably is interested in, 
            and it should therefor be included. This helps achieving the goals of provided information, and attracting sponsors/partners
