        <h2>Administrative details</h2>
        <p>The name of our client is Pareto Invest NTNU, and our contact person within the company is Eirik Lile Vaagen.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="avsnitt">
            <h2>Link to website</h2>
            <p>Here is the link to the website, that is located on NTNU's domain. You will find the P2 document
                in the project folder, then prosjekt-it2805 folder, and then p2.</p>
            <a href="https://folk.ntnu.no/rebeccli/" target="_blank">Website (P2)</a>
        </section>


        <section class="avsnitt">
        <h2>Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
        <p>The client wants a stylish website that provides a good overview of the group that runs Pareto Invest. The two goals of the website is
            to reqruit new members, and to provide a front for companies that Pareto Invest wish to cooperate with - both sponsors and partners.
            The website should therefor provide easy access to information about what Pareto Invest is and how they are working. </p>
        </section>


        <section class="avsnitt">
        <h2>Navigation structure</h2>
            <p>The navigation structure is an important part of the website and the usability.
            Without a good navigation structure, people visting the website may not find what they are looking for. The users
            should have a lot of freedom, and also easily understand the structure of the website.</p>
            <p>As written, our client wishes that the website provides easy access to information about Pareto Invest. Therefore, we have
            decided to have a clique navigation structure, where you can access every page of the webpage from every page. It should 
            be possible to reach the homepage with clicking the at the logo, and the navigation bar will be accessable from all pages.
            In the navigation bar, there will be links pointing to each page. Some of these will not be visible before they are hovered
            upon (dropdown navigation bar), but it should still be possible to reach any page in three or less clicks, which is another goal.</p>

        <section class="avsnitt">
        <h2>Page layout and appearance</h2>
        <p>The universel theme or design is an important part of the users' first impressions of the website, but also of Pareto Invest.
            Our client wishes a professional, simple, and clean design, which reflects the group. Since providing (easy access to) information
            is one of the main goals of the website, the navigation bar should be in focus. The tabs in the navigation bar
            should provide information about what will be found inside the different pages, which will give the users a good overview of
            what the website contains. A professional appearance will also make the group more attractive to 
            students and potential sponsors and investors, which is a crucial part of the website, and one of the main reasons that 
            the website should be created in the first place.
        </p>
        
        <p>The specific styling for the website that will apply to all pages are listed below.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Font
            <br>
            We are going to use a font called "Aktiv Grotesk CD" for the headers, and "Helvetica Neue" for the text.
            </li>
            <li>Color scheme
                <ul>
                    <li>Text: #231F20</li>
                    <li>Background: #F6F5F5</li>
                    <li>Links</li>
                    <li>Shadows</li>
                    <li>Borders of the tabs</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Body width</li>
            <li>Links
                <br>
                The users should be able to reach the homepage from any page, by clicking at the logo
                "Pareto Invest". Also, the navigation bar will be a dropdown menu, which contain 
                links to all pages in the website. In addition, there will be links to social media in 
                the footer. These links will be made as icons. 
            </li>
            <li>Navigation bar
                <br>
                The navigation bar will be located on the top of the page, and will be available on
                all pages. When hovering over the navigation bar, the particular tab will change
                colour to a darker shade.
                <br>
                The font colour in the navigation bar is going to be #231F20, and the background colour should be #B5ACA7.
                The dropdown colour will be #B5ACA7 with 50% transparancy. When hovering the mouse over the tabs in the 
                navigation bar, the colour will change to #D9D9D9 with 30% transparency.
            </li>
            <li>Footer
                <br>
                In the footer, we will include links to social media and contact information about Pareto invest.
                <br>
                The font colour in the footer will be #5A5653, and the background colour should be #B5ACA7.
                Further, we will include the links to social media as icons (facebook.png, instagram.png, linkedin.png),
                and the iconc have 50% transparancy. In addition, we will include a watermark (vannmerke_svart_logo+tittel.png). 
            </li>
            <li>Background image
            <br>
            We will include the same background image on all pages, which is a picture of the facade of the university
            (klæbuveien72_fasade.jpeg). This image will be cropped with 50% transparency. 
            </li>
            <li>Logo/banner
                <br>
                The banner of the website will be Pareto Invest's logo (paretoinvest_liggende_fargetlogo_hvit.jpg).
                It will be located at the top of each page, and will also be a link that brings the user back to the homepage.
            </li>
            <li>Pictures
                <br>
                Values will be specified in percentages, and will be relative to screen size. This will increase the usability 
                of the page, and make it transferable to different size desktops and mobile devices. We also want to add a functionality 
                where the user, by clicking the image, will open a full-size image within the same tab, with an “x”-exit symbol. This way, 
                we can compromise the pages size, simultaneously as the user can choose to view each image full-size.
            </li>
        </ul>

        </section>


        <section class="avsnitt">
        <h2>Content</h2>

        <p>There will be six separate pages as follows:</p>

        <h3>homepage.html</h3>
        <p>As the homepage will be the first page to appear when visiting the site, we want a clear design that isn’t too loud or noisy 
            as a first impression. As Pareto Invest is an investment group, we want it to have a professional and clean look. Therefore, 
            it should not be too much information on this page, as it may be experienced as overwhelming. The information will be provided in other pages on the website.</p>
        <p>The homepage should contain a large picture of the logo as well as the name, so that the user quickly will understand who the 
            site belongs to. In addition, the client has requested a continuous live-updating of the fonds development 
            (with inspiration from Oljefondet).</p>
        <img class="mockup" src="images/mockups/homepage.png" alt="mockup of the homepage">
        <p>Both the header and the picture of the building (fasade.jpg) will have a width of 100% of the body. The reason for this is that we want the website to fit all devices, and to adjust with the size of the screen. The footer and navigation bar will also have a width of 100% of the body size.
            We have four pictures in the footer: a watermark and the logos for LinkedIn, Instagram and Facebook. The logos will act as links to the different social medias of Pareto Invest.</p>

        <h3>about.html</h3>
        <p>The “About” page should be the page where the users will find the information about Pareto invest.
            This page will provide some sort of biography of the group, how they are working, what their goals are,
            and who they are.</p>
        <p>This page is a contributor in achieving the goal that is to provide easy access to information of the group.
            Therefore, the information should be the main part of the page. It will be one of the first impressions for students, 
            and potential sponsors and partners, which again emphasizes the importance of a clean and simple structure.</p>
        <p>There will also be an image of the group on this page.</p>
        <img class="mockup" src="images/mockups/om_oss.png" alt="mockup of the about page">

        <h3>contact.html</h3>
        <p>The “contact” page will allow the user to easily get an overview on how and where to get in contact with Pareto Invest.
            We will include an address to the office (linked to maps), linking to other social media and contact information to the 
            groups appointed contact person/appointed contact email. This page will help fullfilling the goal of the website being a
            platform where students, sponsors and partners (both existing and potential) can reach Pareto Invest.</p>
        <img class="mockup" src="images/mockups/kontakt2.png" alt="mockup of the contact page">

        <h3>sponsors.html</h3>
        <p>The “sponsors” page will provide a systematic and clear overview of the sponsors, ideally in a gallery-layout. 
            The picture of each firms' logo should also be a link to the sponsors' respective websites.
            This way, the user can find out more about the group's collaboration partners, and thereby get into further research. This is important 
            to provide as much information as possible, and thereby build Pareto Invests credibility towards the user. </p>
        <img class="mockup" src="images/mockups/sponsorer2.png" alt="mockup of the sponsor page">

        <h3>macroeconomic_report.html</h3>
        <p>This page will contain the macroeconomic reports from Pareto Invest. Uploading continuous reports is beyond what we will 
            learn but we will create the shell so the client has the opportunity to create it later. The reports is an important part
            of Pareto Invest's work. In addition, it is something the target audience of the website most probably is interested in, 
            and it should therefor be included. This helps achieving the goals of provided information, and attracting sponsors/partners
            and new students.</p>
        <img class="mockup" src="images/mockups/makrorapport.png" alt="mockup of the macroeconomic report page">

        <h3>quarterly_report.html</h3>
        <p>This page will contain the quarterly reports from Pareto Invest. Uploading continuous reports is beyond what we will 
            learn but we will create the shell so the client has the opportunity to create it later. The reports is an important part
            of Pareto Invest's work. In addition, it is something the target audience of the website most probably is interested in, 
            and it should therefor be included. This helps achieving the goals of provided information, and attracting sponsors/partners
            and new students.</p>

            <h2>Minimum requirements</h2>
    
            <ul>
                <li>Functional requirements
                    <ol>
                        <li>Navigation structure
                            <br>
                            The webpage will have a dropdown navigation bar. This will work as a functionalilty on the website,
                            as the user will be able to click their way into different pages within the webpage. We will use
                            JavaScript to implement this function. This will contribute to maintaing a clear layout on the page,
                            but also keeping the choices of the site within reach. This way the user will be able to access all
                            every part of the webpage within a minimum amount of clicks.</li>
                        <li>Continous updating of the funds development
                            <br>
                            As the client has requested, we want the site to contain a continous updating of the funds development.
                            As an inspiration we look to Oljefondet's webpage, where you can follow the development of the funds value.
                            Since we will not be able to implement any data acquisition, we will most likely create a functionin JavaScript,
                            which will contineously update an imaginary value of the fund. This is simply to demonstrate how it would work in
                            practice, and will cound as one of our functionalities.</li>

                        <li>Opening pictures in extended view
                            <br>
                            For some of the pages, such as the "about us"-page we will include pictures of the staff and/or the whole group.
                            As one of our functionalities, we will make it possible that by clicking the images, the user opens an extended view
                            of the picture, still within the same web page.</li>
                        <li>File uploading
                            <br>
                            Ideally, we would include the opportunity for the webpages owner (Pareto Invest) to upload files such as macroeconomic
                            reports and quarterly reports. Later on, the user of the webpage should be able to open these files and/or download
                            the files to their device. Since this is outside of our curriculum, we will create a functionality that demostrates the
                            usage of this function, without acctually managing the file-uploading.
